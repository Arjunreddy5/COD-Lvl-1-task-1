Description:
         In this task, we are simulating a scenario of predictive modeling for housing prices using a dataset inspired by California's housing market. The goal is to develop alinear regression model to predict median house prices based on various features such as geographical coordinates, housing characteristics, and socioeconomic factors.

To achieve this, we first generated a synthetic dataset comprising 20 rows of data, each representing a hypothetical housing unit. The features include longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and median income. These features are commonly considered influential in determining housing prices, as they reflect aspects such as location, property size, and neighborhood demographics.

The dataset was then split into features (X) and the target variable (y), with X containing all the features except median house value, and y containing the median house value. A train-test split was performed to partition the data into a training set used to train the linear regression model and a testing set used to evaluate its performance.

The linear regression model was trained using the training data, where it learned the relationship between the features and the target variable. After training, the model made predictions on the testing set, and its performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), a commonly used metric to measure the accuracy of regression models.

Finally, the predicted median house prices were compared against the actual prices through a scatter plot, providing a visual representation of the model's performance in predicting housing prices. This task provides a foundational understanding of predictive modeling techniques and their application in real-world scenarios such as housing market analysis. 

Conclusion:
        In summary, this task showcased the development of a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features. Using a synthetic dataset resembling California's housing market, we trained and evaluated the model's performance. Through mean squared error (MSE) analysis and a scatter plot comparison of predicted versus actual prices, we observed the model's ability to make accurate predictions. This task underscores the significance of data-driven approaches in understanding and predicting complex phenomena like housing markets, offering insights applicable across diverse fields, from real estate to economic analysis.
